You are implementing **Phase P0 — Formal v10 design doc** for the streamManager v10 RL companion track.

## Branch + base

- Base: `main` AT OR AFTER v2.0 ship tag. If v2.0 has not shipped, ABORT and tell the user (per seed D3).
- PR target: `main`.
- Branch: `docs/v10-formal-design` (or operator's choice).
- Predecessor docs (read first; never inline):
  - `docs/v10-rl-companion-discussion.md` — discussion artefact.
  - `docs/v10-rl-design-seed.md` — D1–D7 resolutions (cherry-pick from `4be19ad` if not on `main`).
  - `docs/v10-rl-design-review.md` — best-practices review + 5-issue treatment table.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Do-not-touch guard

P0 is **docs only**. Verify before commit:

```
git --no-pager diff origin/main..HEAD --stat -- src tests tools dashboard
```

Expected: empty. Any code hunk → STOP.

ADR-18 surface-freeze applies. RL track NEVER modifies any FROZEN symbol or file (full list: `docs/adr/ADR-18-mvp-surface-freeze.md` §"Initial classification"). v10 reads gov state, writes only to `rl_episodes.db` + `rl_proposals/*.json`.

## Task brief

Promote the seed (`docs/v10-rl-design-seed.md`) plus the design review (`docs/v10-rl-design-review.md`) into a single formal design doc. Resolve the five remaining open items listed at the end of the review.

### Deliverables

1. **`docs/v10-rl-design.md`** — formal design. Sections (in order):

   - **Status**: Accepted (v10 P0). Date. Supersedes: seed + review.
   - **Goal**: close the streamManager governance loop with a deterministic-Python contextual bandit over the L4 confidence threshold, off-policy trained on logged Tier 3 + cassette + golden + probe episodes, gated by a 5-stage validation gauntlet, with three hard constraints (FR-OG-7, HITL-agreement floor, alignment-eval pass-rate floor).
   - **Non-goals**: parameterising more than the L4 threshold in v10.1; LLM tokens in the training loop; modifying any FROZEN gov surface; auto-writeback before v10.3.
   - **State-feature schema** — concrete numerical vector. Required columns:
     - `latency_ms_last5_p95: float`
     - `content_length: int`
     - `regex_destructive_match: int` (0/1)
     - `regex_alignment_match: int` (0/1)
     - `time_of_day_bucket: int` (0–23)
     - `session_history_action_share: float[5]` (rolling share of last 5 actions over ALLOW/SUGGEST/INTERVENE/BLOCK/AMBIGUOUS)
     - `routing_band: int` (L1–L4)
     - `trigger_factor: int` (output of `classify_trigger_factor`)
     - `learn_mode_bias_hint: float` (current `bias_consult` advisory output)
   - **Action space** (v10.1): L4 confidence threshold ∈ {0.50, 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95}. 9 bins (the seed says 9 — count the open interval).
   - **Reward formula**:
     ```
     reward_stage_A = 1 if HITL_agreement(action) else 0
     reward_stage_B = reward_stage_A − λ₁ · z(latency_p95) − λ₂ · budget_violation_count
     ```
     Stage A used at v10.1 launch; stage B activates only after λ₁/λ₂ calibration completes per phase 4.
   - **Hard constraints (CMDP)** — candidate is INFEASIBLE and dropped from the action set if ANY:
     1. FR-OG-7 violation count > 0 on golden replay.
     2. HITL agreement < baseline − 2 % on logged subset.
     3. Alignment-eval pass rate < baseline pass rate.
     Constraint violations are NOT encoded as reward penalties.
   - **Posterior family**: Beta-Bernoulli per arm (binned discrete action space). Prior: Beta(α₀, β₀) centered on the current production threshold; α₀ + β₀ = 20 (moderately informative prior, ε-neighbourhood-shaped warm start per seed D6 and predecessor issue #2).
   - **Cadence** (per seed D7): on-demand → weekly post-stability. Weekly slot pre-registered (e.g. Sunday 02:00 local).
   - **Phase ledger** P0 → P5 (this file → phases 1–5; mirror v1.x phase-block format).
   - **Stop conditions table** — copy from `docs/v10-rl-design-review.md` §"Issue #4". Pre-registered.
   - **v10.3 writeback ADR-18 amendment text** — drafted but NOT enacted in v10 P0. Lands when v10.3 promotes.

2. **`docs/v10-task-plan.md`** — phase ledger covering P0–P5 with do-not-touch list. Mirror `docs/v2.0-task-plan.md` format.

3. **`docs/prompts/v10-orchestration/phase-{0,1,2,3,4,5}-*.md`** — 6 orchestration prompts (this file is P0; P1–P5 already minted in design-review pass — verify they exist; if any missing, STOP and ask for re-mint).

4. **No `rl/` subdirectory yet.** P0 is docs only. Code lands in P1.

### Format invariant

Each phase block in the task plan stands alone — copy-pasteable verbatim into a fresh Claude Code session via the matching action prompt. References to memory files use absolute names (no scrollback assumed).

## DOD

- [ ] `docs/v10-rl-design.md` created with all 8 sections above
- [ ] `docs/v10-task-plan.md` created with P0–P5 phase blocks + do-not-touch list (ADR-18 FROZEN list as-is)
- [ ] `docs/prompts/v10-orchestration/phase-{0..5}-*.md` exist (6 files); P1–P5 reviewed for currency against design doc
- [ ] PR scope is docs-only — `git --no-pager diff origin/main..HEAD --stat -- src tests tools dashboard` empty
- [ ] Single PR against `main`
- [ ] Conventional commit prefix `rl:` (NOT `feat:` / `docs:`) so v10 commits filter cleanly per seed D1

## Mint-new-phase rule

P0 is mechanical; no mints expected unless P1–P5 prompts are missing or contradict the formal design doc. If they contradict, ALIGN the prompt to the design doc and note in the PR description.
